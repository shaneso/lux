# Welcome to Lux ✨

Computational modeling can be an expensive task, especially for healthcare institutions. Moreover, current mathematical analysis tools for oncology-related complexities can be inefficient and costly. Lux is a mobile application programmed to simplify statistic forecasting for tumor growth, heterogeneity, and various immunotherapies, including Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL/CD8⁺ T) treatments, and CTL/CD8⁺ T-cell treatments assisted by CD4⁺ T-cell stimulation.

## Introduction

Lux is the first software program in the Luminosity project series. The main objective of Luminosity is to expose the uncertainties of cancer progression in the human body in order to minimize potential risks.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
